					Different people have preferences for a variety of products where each person has an affinity towards a specific product.This affinity between users and products is measured using user-product relationship.  Some products are similar in nature such as books of the same genre, dishes from the same cuisine and this extent of similarity is measured using product-product relationship.Some people are similar is nature because of their age, gender,background and the similarity is measured using user-user relationship.Based on these relationships, we can provide tremendous insights such as recommending similar movies to a specific user (user-product relationship), suggesting an ear phones for a phone(product-product relationship) and suggesting friends to friends on facebook(user-user relationship).Insights can be derived from relationships which can be monetized in the form of recommendations.By knowing the right form of recommendations, we can send personalized promotional emails to the user and can create a personalized home page whenever user visits a web site.</h4></p>

                             Recommender system is very useful for personalization, reducing organizational maintenance, always keeping us up-to-date and suggesting based on real activity. In spite of the emergence of various new forms of entertainment, movies have always been the most prominent and one of the highly preferred forms of entertainment. Everybody loves customization and viewers only want to spend their time and money on something that is close to their taste and something that would get a return on their investment. So, the movie recommender system provides highest possibility for people to like the recommended movies instead of spending their valuable time on searching and watching movies which they wouldn’t like much.

                              In content based filtering, we will find movies with similar attributes and suggest it to the user.
For example, we can suggest the movie “B” to the user who liked movie “A” if both the movies have similar rating against a few same attributes as direction, cast, genre (product attribute similarity).
<ol><li>Content based filtering requires movie attribute database of the user for whom we would like to recommend movies.</li>
<li>The attributes are to be picked based on their impact on the user preferences.</li>
<li>Each movie is shown as a point in an N-dimensional space and the similarity is measured based on the distance between the two points.</li>
<li>Movies are recommended based on their distance from the rated movies by the user.</li><ol>

                        Naive Bayes classifier is a powerful and straightforward algorithm for the classification task.
This classifier gives great results when used for textual data analysis. 
The naive bayes classifier technique is a conditional probability model based on Bayesian theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features.

			 <ul>
			 <li>K value cannot be choosen randomly.The accuracy of the recommendation system depends on the K value hence it should be choosen carefully.As tested,a large K value is more precise as it reduces the overall noise, k value is choosen as 50.
			</li>
			 <li>There are differnt metrics to calculate distance between two users to know the similarity between them.The different metrics are euclidean,correlation and hamming distance.Choosing the distance metric is also a challenge
			 as the accuracy changes based on the distance metrics.We calculated the distance using all the distance metrics and found that euclidean distance gives more accurate results.
